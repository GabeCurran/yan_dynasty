            Chef Yan has over 15 years of experience cooking Chinese cuisine. He is easily considered to be one of the top Szechuan chefs in our area. He has owned and operated Yan Dynasty for 10 years.

        Chef Yan mastered Mandarin and Cantonese cuisines early on in his career. However, over time, his passion turned to the fiery chilis and spices of Szechuan cuisine, a style that he learned predominantly from the world renowned Master Chef and Culinary Teacher Zhongyi Liu.

        Chef Yan went on to hone his Szechuan culinary techniques, launching a signature dish inspired menu that quickly turned the first time Yan Dynasty guest into a loyal customer. His signature dishes, such as the 1000 Chili Pepper Spicy Fish Fillet and the melt-in-your-mouth Spicy Pork Shoulder won him local acclaim.

        Yan's famous five spice blend, which is used in his amazing Pork Shoulder recipe actually has over 8 ingredients. They include cardamom, cinnamon, anise star, Szechuan peppercorn, ginger, onion and a couple of secret ingredients for sweetness. It is mixed with three types of soy sauce and wine.

        “You have to seal the pot and cook the pork for 8 hours until there are 1/3 of the juices left for an incredible rich and glazy sauce. If you unseal the dish to check for doneness, the aromas are lost and the dish is not the same. If you have to unseal the dish to add water, then the dish becomes soggy. Proper technique is key to this dish”.
